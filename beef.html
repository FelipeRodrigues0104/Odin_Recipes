            <li>Season the beef with salt and pepper.</li> 
            <li>Heat a large skillet or pan over medium-high heat and add a small amount of olive oil or butter.</li>

            <li>Deglaze the pan with a splash of beef broth or red wine, if desired, to incorporate the browned bits.</li> 
            <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the beef simmer until it reaches the desired doneness, about 10-15 minutes for medium-rare, or longer for a more well-done texture.</li> 
            <li>Remove the beef from the pan and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing or shredding.</li> 
            <li>Serve the beef hot, garnished with additional herbs or spices, if desired.</li>
